# Wislo Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 12, 2026

At Wislo, we exist to help parents guide their children’s screen time with kindness and care — never to collect more information than necessary.

We are committed to keeping your family’s information safe and private. This policy explains — in plain words — what we collect, why we need it, how we protect it, and how you stay in control.

## 1. What Information We Collect

### Information You Give Us
When you set up Wislo, we ask for:
- Your name and mobile number (so we know it’s really you managing the family settings).
- A master password for the parent account (to keep settings secure).
- Your child’s first name and school grade (to personalise the experience).
- A simple profile password for your child (so they can use Wislo without changing important settings).

### Information Wislo Learns While Helping You
To show accurate screen-time reports and apply the rules you choose, the app notices:
- Which apps your child opens and how long they spend in each.
- When a tracked app is launched (so we can show the lock screen or grade based question at the right moment).
- Basic device info (phone model and Android version) — only to make sure Wislo works smoothly on your device.

### Tools We Use Behind the Scenes
We use Firebase (a Google service trusted by millions of apps) to:
- Understand how people use Wislo so we can keep improving it
- Quickly find and fix crashes or bugs.

We never use these tools to track you outside the app or build advertising profiles.

## 2. The Permissions We Ask For — And Exactly Why

Wislo needs a few special Android permissions to do its job properly. We always explain them clearly when you turn them on, and you can turn them off anytime.

- **Accessibility Service** (“App Detection”)
  Lets Wislo notice when your child opens an app. We use this **only** to show the lock screen or ask the grade based question at the perfect moment.
  **Privacy Guarantee:** Wislo **never** reads your messages, sees what anyone is typing, views photos, listens to audio, or accesses personal content of any kind.

- **Usage Access**
  Lets us count time spent in different apps so the Parent Dashboard shows honest, helpful reports.

- **Notifications**
  Helps Wislo stay running smoothly and deliver grade based questions to your child while they’re using the phone.

All these permissions are required for Wislo to work properly — please keep them enabled to make use of the app functionalities.

## 3. Where We Keep Your Information

- Most data (profile details, daily usage summary) lives **only on your phone** in a private, protected area — so everything works fast even without internet.
- A small amount of necessary information (names, your phone number, usage summary) is sent to our secure servers so the Parent Dashboard stays up-to-date from any device and even when the child’s phone is offline.
- Everything that travels between your phone and our servers is strongly encrypted the whole way.

## 4. We Never Sell Your Family’s Information

We do **not** sell, rent, or trade any of your family’s data — ever.

We share analytical data **only** in these very limited situations:
- With trusted technical partners (like Firebase, a Google service trusted by millions of apps) who help keep the app stable and reliable — they are strictly not allowed to use the data for their own purposes
- If required by law, to protect someone’s safety, or to follow a valid court order

That’s it.

## 5. You Are Always in Control

- **Uninstalling the app** → All data stored locally on the phone is automatically removed.
- **“Delete My Data”** option (found in App Settings) → Permanently deletes your account, your child’s profile, all usage history, and everything we hold on our servers. This usually completes within a few hours.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Wislo is built for parents and guardians.
We never collect information directly from children. A parent must install the app, create the profiles, and give permission before anything is tracked.
We follow children’s privacy rules very carefully.

## 7. Security & External Links

We take security seriously and use strong protections — but no system on the internet can promise 100% safety.
If you click a link inside Wislo that takes you to another website, that site has its own privacy rules — please check them.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

If we ever need to make important changes, we will tell you inside the app and/or by email.
We recommend checking back here from time to time.

This policy follows Indian law. Any questions or disputes will be handled under the laws of Karnataka, with courts in Bengaluru having jurisdiction.
