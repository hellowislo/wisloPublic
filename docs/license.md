# Wislo Terms of Service
**Last Updated: February 12, 2026**

By downloading or using Wislo, these terms automatically apply to you. Please read them carefully before using the application.

## 1. Description of Service
Wislo is a productivity and parental monitoring tool designed to help parents manage their children's screen time through app locking and interactive questioning.

## 2. Eligibility and Responsibility
* **Parental Consent:** If you are a parent or guardian, by allowing your child to use the app, you agree to these terms on their behalf.
* **Lawful Use:** You agree to use this app only for monitoring minors for whom you are the legal guardian. Using this app to monitor adults or individuals without their explicit consent may violate local privacy laws and is strictly prohibited.

## 3. Account Security
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the **Master Password**. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your parent profile.

## 4. Usage Rules
* You must not attempt to bypass the app's security features.
* The apps features require an active internet connection to function properly.

## 5. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
* **"As-Is" Basis:** Wislo is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.
* While we strive for 100% uptime, the app's ability to lock other applications depends on the Android OS and device-specific battery optimization settings. We are not liable for any failure to block an app.
* **No Guarantee of Accuracy:** Usage statistics are provided for informational purposes and may vary slightly from system-reported data.

## 6. Data Deletion
We provide a "Delete My Data" feature within the app. Upon using this feature, your data will be queued for deletion from our servers. Once deleted, this data cannot be recovered.

## 7. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

If we ever need to make important changes, we will tell you inside the app and/or by email.
We recommend checking back here from time to time.

This policy follows Indian law. Any questions or disputes will be handled under the laws of Karnataka, with courts in Bengaluru having jurisdiction.
