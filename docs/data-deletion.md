# Wislo Data Deletion Policy & Instructions

Last Updated: February 12, 2026

At Wislo, we believe you should have complete control over your family's data. If you decide to delete all your data and stop using our service, we provide a simple and transparent way to permanently erase your information from both your device and our servers.

## 1. How to Delete Your Data

You can trigger a data deletion directly from within the Wislo app. Follow these steps:

1. Open the **Wislo** app.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Tap **"Delete My Data"**.
4. Enter your **Master Password** to confirm your identity.

This starts the full deletion process immediately.

## 2. What Gets Permanently Deleted

This action shall permanently delete all your Profile information associated with your account. And doing this you will never be able to retrieve it again, including:

- Parent and child profile information (names, mobile numbers etc..)
- All questionnaire responses
- Complete usage history (screen time logs, app launches, reports)
- Any other data associated with your account

**This cannot be undone.** After deletion, reinstalling Wislo will require creating a new account from scratch.

## 3. Deletion Process Details

- **On your phone** — All local data (profiles, cached settings, logs) is cleared instantly.
- **On our servers** — We immediately queue your data for permanent removal. We will not use or share this data during or after the process.

Only truly anonymized, aggregated statistics (with no personal identifiers) may be retained for app improvement or legal compliance — never linked back to you or your family.

## 4. Alternative Deletion Method
If you have already uninstalled the app and wish to ensure your server-side data is removed, please email us from the mobile number associated with your account:

**Email:** hellowislo@gmail.com

**Subject:** Data Deletion Request – [Your Mobile Number]

Include your mobile number in the email body for verification. We process these requests promptly and send a confirmation once complete.

## 5. Our Commitment

Wislo follows best practices for data protection, especially for families and children. Deletion is designed to be straightforward and complete so you always stay in control.

Thank you for trusting Wislo.
